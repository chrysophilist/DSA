//Type of data structure
//1. PHYSICAL DATA STRUCTURE: They store the data in the memory
    //a. ARRAY:
        //it's a data structure
        //Fixed size
        //can't be increase or decrease
        //static memory allocation (Compile time)
        //can be created either inside STACK or inside the HEAP
        //Random Access
        //Sequential Representation
        //Insertion and Deletion takes more time
        // 1D, 2D, 3D,....Multi D

    //b. LINKED LIST:
        //It's a data structure
        //dynamic data structure(dynamic memory allocation, In RUN time)
        //collect of nodes where each node contains data and linked to next node
        //length of linked list can be increase or reduce
        //always created in HEAP
        //Sequential Access
        //Linked representation
        //Insertion and deletion FAST
        //SLL, DLL, CLL


//2. LOGICAL DATA STRUCTURE:
    //a. LINEAR DATA STRUCTURE:
            //i. STACK: 
                    //LIFO

            //ii. QUEUES:
                    //FIFO

    //b. NON-LINEAR DATA STRUCTURE:
            //iii. TREES:
                    //Hierarchy

            //iv. GRAPH

    //c. TABULAR DATA STRUCTURE:
            //v. HASH TABLE
